      <h2 id="chapter-3" style="text-align: center;">Chapter 3: Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables</h2>
      <h3>Exercise 3.1</h3>
    
      <div class="question">1. Form the pair of linear equations and find their solutions graphically.</div>
      <div class="answer">
    (i) Let boys = x, girls = y  
    Given: Total students = 10 → x + y = 10  
    Girls are 4 more than boys → y = x + 4  
    Rewrite y = x + 4 as x - y = -4  
    Pair of equations:  
    x + y = 10  
    x - y = -4  
    Solution by adding: 2x = 6 → x = 3 boys  
    y = 3 + 4 = 7 girls
    
    (ii) Let cost of pencil = x, pen = y  
    5x + 7y = 50  
    7x + 5y = 46  
    Multiply first by 7, second by 5 and subtract:  
    35x + 49y = 350  
    35x + 25y = 230  
    Subtract: 24y = 120 → y = 5  
    Put y=5 in first eq: 5x + 35 = 50 → 5x = 15 → x = 3  
    Cost: Pencil = ₹3, Pen = ₹5
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">2. Compare ratios to find nature of lines:</div>
      <div class="answer">
    (i) 5x – 4y + 8 = 0 and 7x + 6y – 9 = 0  
    a₁/a₂ = 5/7, b₁/b₂ = -4/6 = -2/3, c₁/c₂ = 8/-9  
    Ratios not equal → Lines intersect  
    
    (ii) 9x + 3y + 12 = 0 and 18x + 6y + 24 = 0  
    a₁/a₂ = 9/18 = 1/2, b₁/b₂ = 3/6 = 1/2, c₁/c₂ = 12/24 = 1/2  
    All ratios equal → Lines coincident  
    
    (iii) 6x – 3y + 10 = 0 and 2x – y + 9 = 0  
    a₁/a₂ = 6/2 = 3, b₁/b₂ = -3/-1 = 3, c₁/c₂ = 10/9  
    Ratios a and b equal, c different → Lines parallel
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">3. Consistency check using ratios:</div>
      <div class="answer">
    (i) 3x + 2y = 5 ; 2x – 3y = 7  
    Ratios a: 3/2, b: 2/-3, c: 5/7 → Not equal → Consistent (intersect)  
    
    (ii) 2x – 3y = 8 ; 4x – 6y = 9  
    Ratios a: 2/4=1/2, b: -3/-6=1/2, c: 8/9 ≠ 1/2 → Inconsistent (parallel)  
    
    (iii) 3x + 5y = 7 ; 2x – 3y = 14  
    Ratios differ → Consistent  
    
    (iv) 5x – 3y = 11 ; -10x + 6y = -22  
    Multiply first by 2: 10x - 6y = 22  
    Second: -10x + 6y = -22  
    Adding both: 0 = 0 → Coincident (consistent)  
    
    (v) 4x + 2y = 8 ; 3x + 2y = 12  
    Ratios differ → Consistent
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">4. Which pairs are consistent/inconsistent? Solutions graphically if consistent:</div>
      <div class="answer">
    (i) x + y = 5, 2x + 2y = 10  
    Second eq. is just twice first → Coincident (consistent)  
    
    (ii) x – y = 8, 3x – 3y = 16  
    Second eq. thrice first would be 3x - 3y = 24 ≠ 16 → Intersect (consistent)  
    
    (iii) 2x + y – 6 = 0, 4x – 2y – 4 = 0  
    Check ratios: Not equal → Intersect (consistent)  
    
    (iv) 2x – 2y – 2 = 0, 4x – 4y – 5 = 0  
    Ratios of a and b equal but c different → Parallel (inconsistent)
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">5. Find dimensions of rectangular garden:</div>
      <div class="answer">
    Let width = x m, length = x + 4 m  
    Half perimeter = 36 → (Length + Width) = 36  
    x + (x + 4) = 36  
    2x + 4 = 36 → 2x = 32 → x = 16  
    Width = 16 m, Length = 20 m
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">6. Given 2x + 3y – 8 = 0, write another line for:</div>
      <div class="answer">
    (i) Intersecting lines: Example 3x – y + 1 = 0 (different slope)  
    
    (ii) Parallel lines: 4x + 6y – 10 = 0 (multiple of first but different c)  
    
    (iii) Coincident lines: 4x + 6y – 16 = 0 (exact multiple of first eq.)
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">7. Graphs of x – y + 1 = 0 and 3x + 2y – 12 = 0 and triangle vertices:</div>
      <div class="answer">
    Find intercepts:  
    
    For x – y + 1 = 0  
    x-intercept: Put y=0 → x + 1 = 0 → x = -1  
    y-intercept: Put x=0 → -y + 1=0 → y=1  
    
    For 3x + 2y – 12 = 0  
    x-intercept: y=0 → 3x=12 → x=4  
    y-intercept: x=0 → 2y=12 → y=6  
    
    Find intersection of two lines:  
    From first line: y = x + 1  
    Put in second: 3x + 2(x +1) –12=0 → 3x + 2x + 2 –12=0 → 5x –10=0 → x=2  
    y = 2 +1=3

      <h3>Exercise 3.2  </h3>
    
      <div class="question">1. Solve the following pairs of linear equations by the substitution method.</div>
      <div class="answer">
    
    (i)  
    x + y = 14  
    x – y = 4  
    
    Substitute y = 14 – x in second:  
    x – (14 – x) = 4 → 2x – 14 = 4 → 2x = 18 → x = 9  
    y = 14 – 9 = 5
    
    (ii)  
    s – t = 3  
    (6/3)s + (2/3)t = 1 → 2s + (2/3)t = 1 (rewrite second)  
    
    Rewrite second:  
    Multiply whole eq by 3: 6s + 2t = 3  
    Express s = t + 3 from first eq:  
    Substitute: 6(t+3) + 2t = 3 → 6t + 18 + 2t = 3 → 8t = -15 → t = -15/8  
    s = t + 3 = -15/8 + 24/8 = 9/8
    
    (iii)  
    3x – y = 3  
    9x – 3y = 9  
    
    From first: y = 3x – 3  
    Put in second: 9x – 3(3x – 3) = 9 → 9x – 9x + 9 = 9 → 9=9 true → Infinite solutions  
    
    (iv)  
    0.2x + 0.3y = 1.3  
    0.4x + 0.5y = 2.3  
    
    From first: 0.2x = 1.3 – 0.3y → x = (1.3 – 0.3y)/0.2 = 6.5 – 1.5y  
    Put in second: 0.4(6.5 – 1.5y) + 0.5y = 2.3 → 2.6 – 0.6y + 0.5y = 2.3  
    –0.1y = –0.3 → y = 3  
    x = 6.5 – 1.5(3) = 6.5 – 4.5 = 2
    
    (v)  
    √2 x + √3 y = 0  
    √3 x – √8 y = 0  
    
    From first: √2 x = –√3 y → x = –(√3/√2) y  
    Put in second: √3 (–(√3/√2) y) – √8 y = 0  
    – (3/√2) y – 2√2 y = 0  
    Multiply all by √2: –3 y – 2*2 y = 0 → –3 y –4 y = 0 → –7 y = 0 → y = 0  
    Then x = 0
    
    (vi)  
    (3x)/2 – (5y)/3 = –2  
    x/3 + y/2 = 13/6  
    
    Multiply second eq by 6: 2x + 3y = 13  
    Multiply first eq by 6: 9x – 10y = –12  
    
    From second: 2x = 13 – 3y → x = (13 – 3y)/2  
    Put in first: 9(13 – 3y)/2 – 10y = –12  
    Multiply both sides by 2: 9(13 – 3y) – 20y = –24  
    117 – 27y – 20y = –24 → –47y = –141 → y = 3  
    x = (13 – 3*3)/2 = (13 – 9)/2 = 2
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">2. Solve 2x + 3y = 11 and 2x – 4y = –24 and find the value of m for which y = mx + 3.</div>
      <div class="answer">
    From first: 2x + 3y = 11  
    From second: 2x – 4y = –24  
    
    Subtract second from first: (2x + 3y) – (2x – 4y) = 11 – (–24)  
    2x + 3y – 2x + 4y = 35  
    7y = 35 → y = 5  
    
    Put y = 5 in first: 2x + 15 = 11 → 2x = –4 → x = –2  
    
    Equation y = mx + 3 passes through (–2, 5):  
    5 = m(–2) + 3 → 5 – 3 = –2m → 2 = –2m → m = –1
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">3. Form pairs of linear equations and solve by substitution:</div>
      <div class="answer">
     <b>(i) The difference between two numbers is 26 and one number is three times the other.
        Find them.</b>  
    
    Let numbers be x and y:  
    
    x – y = 26  
    x = 3y  
    Substitute x = 3y in first: 3y – y = 26 → 2y = 26 → y = 13  
    
    
    x = 3*13 = 39
    
    
    
    <b>(ii) Larger supplementary angle exceeds smaller by 18°</b>  
    
    Let smaller = x, larger = y  
    
    x + y = 180  
    
    y – x = 18  
    
    Add: 2y = 198 → y = 99  
    
    x = 180 – 99 = 81
    
    <b>(iii)The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for ` 3800. Later, she buys 3
    bats and 5 balls for ` 1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.</b>  
    
    7 bats + 6 balls = ₹3800
    
    3 bats + 5 balls = ₹1750
    
    Let cost of bat = x, ball = y  
    
    7x + 6y = 3800  
    3x + 5y = 1750  
    
    From second: 3x = 1750 – 5y → x = (1750 – 5y)/3  
    
    Put in first: 7((1750 – 5y)/3) + 6y = 3800  
    
    Multiply all by 3: 7(1750 – 5y) + 18y = 11400  
    
    12250 – 35y + 18y = 11400  
    
    –17y = 11400 – 12250 = –850 → y = 50  
    
    x = (1750 – 5*50)/3 = (1750 – 250)/3 = 1500/3 = 500  
    
    Cost: Bat = ₹500, Ball = ₹50
    
    
    <b>(iv) Fixed charge = x, charge per km = y</b>  
    
    10x + 10y = 105  
    
    15x + 15y = 155  
    
    
    Since fixed charge + (distance × rate) = total  
    
    Let fixed charge = f, rate = r  
    
    So: f + 10r = 105  
    f + 15r = 155  
    
    Subtract: (f + 15r) – (f + 10r) = 155 – 105 → 5r = 50 → r = 10  
    
    
    Put r in first: f + 10*10 = 105 → f = 5  
    
    For 25 km: Charge = f + 25r = 5 + 250 = ₹255

    Cross multiply both:  
    11(x + 2) = 9(y + 2) → 11x + 22 = 9y + 18 → 11x – 9y = –4 ...(1)  
    6(x + 3) = 5(y + 3) → 6x + 18 = 5y + 15 → 6x – 5y = –3 ...(2)  
    
    Multiply (1) by 5: 55x – 45y = –20  
    Multiply (2) by 9: 54x – 45y = –27  
    Subtract: 55x – 54x = –20 + 27 → x = 7  
    Put x = 7 in (2): 6*7 – 5y = –3 → 42 – 5y = –3 → –5y = –45 → y = 9  
    Fraction = 7/9
    
    <b>(vi)Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years

    Let present age of Jacob = J  
    
    Let present age of son = S
    
    
    Five years hence:  
    Jacob's age = J + 5  
    Son's age = S + 5  
    Given: J + 5 = 3(S + 5)  
    → J + 5 = 3S + 15

    Subtract (2) from (1):  
        (J - 3S) - (J - 7S) = 10 - (-30)  
    J - 3S - J + 7S = 40

        <div class="question">
          (i) If we add 1 to the numerator and subtract 1 from the denominator, a fraction reduces to 1. It becomes 1/2 if we only add 1 to the denominator. What is the fraction?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
      Let the fraction = x/y
      
      From first condition:  
      (x + 1) / (y - 1) = 1  
      → x + 1 = y - 1  
      → x - y = -2  ...(1)
      
      From second condition:  
      x / (y + 1) = 1/2  
      → 2x = y + 1  
      → 2x - y = 1  ...(2)
      
      Multiply (1) by 2:  
      2x - 2y = -4
      
      Subtract (2) from this:  
      (2x - 2y) - (2x - y) = -4 - 1  
      2x - 2y - 2x + y = -5  
      -y = -5  
      y = 5
      
      Put y = 5 in (1):  
      x - 5 = -2  
      x = 3
      
      <b>Answer:</b> The fraction is 3/5.

          (ii) Five years ago, Nuri was thrice as old as Sonu. Ten years later, Nuri will be twice as old as Sonu. How old are Nuri and Sonu?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
      Let present age of Nuri = N
      Let present age of Sonu = S
      
      Five years ago:  
      N - 5 = 3(S - 5)  
      → N - 5 = 3S - 15  
      → N - 3S = -10  ...(1)
      
      Ten years later:  
      N + 10 = 2(S + 10)  
      → N + 10 = 2S + 20  
      → N - 2S = 10  ...(2)
      
      Subtract (2) from (1):  
      (N - 3S) - (N - 2S) = -10 - 10  
      N - 3S - N + 2S = -20  
      -S = -20  
      S = 20
      
      Put S = 20 in (2):  
      N - 2(20) = 10  
      N - 40 = 10  
      N = 50

          (iii) The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
      Let the digits be x (tens) and y (ones).
      
      From sum of digits:  
      x + y = 9  ...(1)
      
      Number = 10x + y  
      Reversed number = 10y + x
      
      Given: 9 × (10x + y) = 2 × (10y + x)  
      → 90x + 9y = 20y + 2x  
      → 90x - 2x = 20y - 9y  
      → 88x = 11y  
      → 8x = y  ...(2)
      
      Put y = 8x in (1):  
      x + 8x = 9  
      9x = 9  
      x = 1
      
      Then y = 8 × 1 = 8
      
      <b>Answer:</b> The number is 18.

      Total amount:  
      50x + 100y = 2000  
      Divide by 50:  
      x + 2y = 40  ...(2)
      
      Subtract (1) from (2):  
      (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 40 - 25  
      x + 2y - x - y = 15  
      y = 15
